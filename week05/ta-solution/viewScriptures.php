<?php

// In this example, for simplicity, the query is executed
// right here and the data echoed out as we iterate the query.

// You could imagine that in a more involved application, we
// would likely query the database in a completely separate file / function
// and build a list of objects that held the components of each
// scripture. Then, here on the page, we could simply call that 
// function, and iterate through the list that was returned and
// print each component.



// First, prepare the statement

// Notice that we avoid using "SELECT *" here. This is considered
// good practice so we don't inadvertently bring back data we don't
// want, especially if the database changes later.
$statement = $db->prepare("SELECT book, chapter, verse, content FROM scripture");
$statement->execute();

// Go through each result
while ($row = $statement->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC))
{
	// The variable "row" now holds the complete record for that
	// row, and we can access the different values based on their
	// name
	$book = $row['book'];
	$chapter = $row['chapter'];
	$verse = $row['verse'];
	$content = $row['content'];

	echo "<p><strong>$book $chapter:$verse</strong> - \"$content\"<p>";
